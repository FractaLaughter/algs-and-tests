Just messing around with the code. How small can I make it?
Started with a basic function and an if statement recursion to generate a binary value from a decimal number. 
Found myself struggling to get it to run properly because I didn't know where or how to declare my variables as strings, integers or decimals. 
The code I used to genereate the next iteration divided the ins by 2 and if it were an integer, this would have kicked out the .5's.
Because the ins had the decimal, I made it subtract the ins%2 from the ins before dividing by 2. This made the ins an even number no matter what.
I then rewrote the code in a single line ternary statement.

I think it looks super clean, but I still dont know how to declare variables with a type other that adding ="" to make it a string.
